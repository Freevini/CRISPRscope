## Abstract

Phages are believed to be key drivers of genomic diversity in nearly clonal populations of bacteria as they impose strong selective pressure on the evolution of bacterial defense mechanisms. The maintenance of such diversity can be explained by the pan-immunity model, which suggests that bacterial immune systems are frequently gained and lost from bacterial genomes and that the effective defense repertoire of a given strain or species is defined by all defense systems present in the population. A few studies have analyzed the distribution of immune systems in microbial communities, but they have focused on relatively complex communities from diverse environments. Here we focused on cheese-associated communities that are usually dominated by a few bacterial taxa and are found in relatively stable environments. We used (meta)genomics analysis as a first comprehensive study of innate and adaptive immune systems (i.e. CRISPR-Cas) in these communities. We observed a high standing genetic diversity of phage defense mechanisms with near-clonal strains having very different innate defense arsenals and CRISPR spacers repertoires. The CRISPR diversity is mainly fueled by several novel spacers acquired every generation within a community. On the contrary, the abundance of CRISPR spacers can be explained by the selection of spacers targeting prevalent phage targets. Interestingly, CRISPR spacers only provide immunity to a subset of the phages identified in cheese. Overall, our findings corroborate that  standing genetic diversity, horizontal transfer and selection are dominating forces in defense system distribution within natural microbial communities.
